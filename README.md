Run ./bin/messenger.rb to start typing your message or provide a file as a param like

    ./bin/messenger.rb < /path/my_file.txt

 Encrypted text will be save in a file called _encrypted_message.txt_

 To run all the test just the usual

     rspec spec/

I'll be happy to discuss and elaborate more about the code if requested.

Cheers and enjoy!
